### 1-star (wave 1 - straight line)
- Five enemy planes are lined up in a "straight line" and start flying from the left boundary towards the right. The horizontal spacing between enemy planes is 20px.
- After all five enemy planes have left the screen, they reappear from the left boundary. 
- When they appear, their y-axis positions must be random, and all five enemy planes must be within the height range of the canvas.
### 2-star (wave 2 - diagonal line)
- There are two waves of enemy planes. After the first wave of five enemy planes (Level C) have left the screen, the second wave of enemy planes appears from the left boundary. 
- The second wave of five enemy planes is arranged in a "diagonal line." After they leave the screen, the first wave of five enemy planes reappears. The vertical spacing between enemy planes is -20px.
- When they appear, their y-axis positions must be random, and all five enemy planes must be within the height range of the canvas.
### 3-star (wave 3 - diamond  formation)
- There are three waves of enemy planes. The first and second waves are as described in B and C levels.
- The third wave consists of eight planes arranged in a diamond shape, flying out from the left boundary. There is no spacing between the enemy planes. After the third wave is finished, the cycle returns to the first wave and repeats.
- When they appear, their y-axis positions must be random, and all five enemy planes must be within the height range of the canvas.
